Header
======

This is a page listing all potential header keywords for an `Observatory` object.

.. Note::
    This is auto-generated from the `info` dictionaries in the `Observatory` class. Some
    of the information is not available for all observatories, and some header values may
    contain nonsense due to the auto-generation script.
